# notch-filter-design-using-octave

A speech signal with bandwidth of 4 kHz is sampled at 8 kHz. The signal is corrupted by sinusoids with frequencies 1 kH, 2 kHz, and 3 kHz.

1. Design an IIR filter using notch filter components that eliminates these sinusoidal signals.

2. Choose the gain of the filter so that the maximum gain is equal to 1 and plot the log-magnitude response of your filter.

3. Load the handel sound file in OCTAVE and add the preceding three sinusoidal signals to create a corrupted sound signal. Now filter the corrupted sound signal using your filter and comment on its performance.

Prepare a project report (Design procedure, Code, Plots) in Document format.
